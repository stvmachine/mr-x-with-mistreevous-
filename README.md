# ðŸš€ My Awesome Side Project  

> Inspiration has many names. In my case, it's called **Mr. X**â€”a mysterious entity that whispers ideas into my brain at 2 AM and promptly disappears before I can ask for details. **Mr. X is scary...**  

Welcome to my side project! This started as a simple idea, then spiraled into something far more ambitious, fueled by late-night caffeine and questionable life choices.  

## ðŸŽ¯ What Is This?  
It's a **beehaviour tree entity** (Mr X) that relentlessly pursues you across the map to eliminate you. If you've ever thought, "*Why doesn't this exist in Typescript?*"â€”well, now it does!  


## ðŸ›  Installation  

```sh
npm install  
npm run dev
```

### Features

This project utilizes the following libraries:
	â€¢	React with Vite starter 
	â€¢	Konva â€“ A 2D canvas library for rendering interactive graphics efficiently.
	â€¢	Mistreevous â€“ A behavior tree library used for modeling complex decision-making processes.

### Behavior Trees with Mistreevous

Mistreevous provides a structured way to define AI behaviors using behavior trees. This allows for modular, reusable, and predictable decision-making logic, making it ideal for handling AI-driven interactions. Behavior trees are particularly useful in:
	â€¢	Defining sequential and parallel tasks
	â€¢	Handling conditional logic dynamically
	â€¢	Creating adaptable AI behaviors that can react to different inputs and states

Mistreevous introduces a balance between determinism and randomized behaviors, making it a powerful tool for designing sophisticated AI logic.
